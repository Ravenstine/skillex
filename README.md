Skills In Pills
===============

A nicer way to write Alexa skills. (WIP)

- Rapidly prototype fun & useful skills through human-readable configuration.
- Easily handle many complex states within a skill.
- Compile your intent schema from your skill configuration.  Never be baffled at synatx errors in your schema.†

## Structure

A skill is configured almost entirely through YAML files called "pills".  If you are familiar with [how to write YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/), then you know how to write a skill with pills.  An entire skill can be represented in a single pill(entrypoint.yml), or multiple pills can be used to represent groups of states(e.x. different "scenes" in a text adventure game).

## Getting Started

At the moment, Skills in Pills is available simply as an app skeleton.  Follow these instructions to install:

- Fork & clone the repo.
- Run `npm install` in the project directory.
- Install [Bespoken Tools](https://bespoken.tools/): `npm install -g bespoken-tools`

## Core Concepts

A skill is configured almost entirely through YAML files referred to as "pills".  If you are familiar with [how to write YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/), then you know how to write a skill with pills.  An entire skill can be represented in a single pill, or multiple pills can be used to represent groups of states(e.g. different "scenes" in a text adventure game).  `entrypoint.yml` is always the default pill.

Each pill contains one or more "labels", which are merely the top-level objects in a pill.  You can think of them as the equivalent of functions in a programming language, though they are much more constrained than that.  A label can contain a variety of keys & values that build a skill response.

For example, a label can have a `speak:` key that defines the speech text that is returned to an Alexa-enabled device.  If you want to ask the user a question and wait for a response, you would define that with a `ask:`.

## Tutorial

Let's make a new skill with pills.

In `pills/entrypoint.yml`, you'll see the following:

```yaml
Intro:
  speak: Congratulations!  You've successuflly run your first skill with pills.
```

Before we continue, build your schema by running `node compiler.js`.  This will write a JSON file to the `schemas/` directory.

Now it's time to run the Bespoken Tools proxy server:

```sh
bst proxy lambda index.js --pithy
```

The output of that command will say something like `Your URL for Alexa Skill configuration:` and a link.  Copy that link down for later.

### Skill Setup

Now we just need to tie things into a new skill configuration.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon developer portal](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html). If you haven’t done so already, you’ll need to create a free account.
2. From the top navigation bar, select **Alexa**.
3. Under **Alexa Skills Kit**, choose **Get Started >**.
4. Choose **Add a New Skill**.
5. Name your skill and add an "invocation name".  This is the word or phrase that users will speak to activate the skill.  We'll use "my skill" as the invocation name for this tutorial.  Save and continue.
6. Click on the button that says "Launch Skill Builder Beta".  Skills In Pills doesn't currently support the old builder.
7. In the "Code Editor" tab, drag and drop the JSON file you built earlier into the window, then click **Apply Changes**.
8. Click **Build Model**.  This may take a few minutes.  Then click the button at the top that says **Configuration**.
9. Under **Endpoint**, select *HTTPS* and tick the box of whichever region is closest to you.  In my case, that's `North America`.  Paste the URL we saved from earlier into the text field, then click **Next**.
10. In the **SSL Certificate** section, under **Certificate for NA Endpoint:**, choose "My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority".

Your skill is now ready to be tested.  You can either test it using the service simulator, [Echosim.io](https://echosim.io/), or an Echo device associated with your developer account.

Bespoken Tools is a useful tool that allows you to develop Alexa skills locally, without having to use AWS Lambda.  It also reloads your code automatically when you make changes.

### Tutorial Cont'd

The skill can be invoked by saying "Alexa, open my skill."

Your device will then respond with "Congratulations!  You've successuflly run your first skill with pills."

If that's the response you get, then you're good to go.  This is a pretty boring skill, though.  Let's make something more interesting!

```yaml
# pills/entrypoint.yml

Intro:
  speak: I know all sorts of things about animals.
```

We've changed the dialog, and your skill reflects that change immediately when you invoke it.  It's still very stupid, and there's no form of interaction.  Let's ask the user for the name of an animal.

```yaml
# pills/entrypoint.yml

Intro:
  speak: I know all sorts of things about animals.
  ask: What's your favorite animal?
```

Upon reinvoking the skill, you'll notice that the Echo device will wait for a response, but does nothing more even if you respond to it.  Let's actually make it listen to what you have to say by adding an intent.

```yaml
# pills/entrypoint.yml

Intro:
  speak: I know all sorts of things about animals.
  ask: What's your favorite animal?
  utterances:
    ${animal}:
      go to: Read Animal Fact
```

Hmm... that's not how you write an intent name... is it?  That looks more like a sample utterance.  Anyway, moving on.

Because we have now changed how the interaction model works, we have to generate a new intent schema by running `node compiler.js`.  Let's check out what's in that new file.

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "name": "AMAZON.CancelIntent",
      "samples": [],
      "slots": []
    },
    {
      "name": "AMAZON.HelpIntent",
      "samples": [],
      "slots": []
    },
    {
      "name": "AMAZON.StopIntent",
      "samples": [],
      "slots": []
    },
    {
      "name": "AnimalIntent",
      "samples": [
        "{animal}"
      ],
      "slots": [
        {
          "name": "animal",
          "type": "AMAZON.Animal",
          "samples": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "types": []
}
```

How did it do that???

The compiler looked at the utterance you wrote and derived an intent name, a sample utterance, an a slot including the slot type!  When you define a slot in your intent by itself with no type specified, it will attempt to guess the type based on the name if it matches an Amazon built-in slot type.  We'll learn about defining types later on.  For now, this will work perfectly.

Upload this schema in the Skill Builder and build the interaction model.  When that's done, reinvoke your skill by saying "Alexa, open my skill."

Oh, snap!  It asked you what your favorite animal is but still did nothing with your response!  Let's see if we can get it to talk back with the name you gave it.

```yaml
# pills/entrypoint.yml

Intro:
  speak: I know all sorts of things about animals.
  ask: What's your favorite animal?
  utterances:
    ${animal}:
      go to: Read Animal Fact

Read Animal Fact:
  speak: You said ${animal}.
```

Now if you tell it that you like crocodiles, it will say "You like crocodiles."  How... useless.  Let's make your skill useful!

```yaml
# pills/entrypoint.yml

Intro:
  speak: I know all sorts of things about animals.
  ask: What's your favorite animal?
  utterances:
    ${animal}:
      go to: Read Animal Fact

Read Animal Fact:
  web request: 
    url: https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&redirects=1&action=query&prop=extracts&exintro=&explaintext=&titles=${animal}
    pluck: extract
  speak: You said ${animal}. ${webResponse}.
```

Incredible!  You've written a skill that takes user input and returns useful information!  A skill can really be this simple.  But there are some finishing touches we should add.

```yaml
# pills/entrypoint.yml

Start:
  utterances:
    ${animal}:
      go to: Read Animal Fact
  go to: Intro

Intro:
  speak: I know all sorts of things about animals.
  ask: What's your favorite animal?
  utterances:
    ${animal}:
      go to: Read Animal Fact

Read Animal Fact:
  web request:
    url: https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&redirects=1&action=query&prop=extracts&exintro=&explaintext=&titles=${animal}
    pluck: extract
    none speech: I don't know about ${animal}.
  speak: You said ${animal}. ${webResponse}.
```

Since we want a user to also be able to invoke the skill by saying "Alexa, ask my skill about monkeys", we've added a new label at the top of the pill that directs us between the intro and the fact reader.  The label at the top of a pill is always the first to be executed during a session.  You can think of what we created as a "router" label.

Sometimes you'll ask it something it will not know about.  In that case, the `none speak:` key in the web request overrides the label dialog if the search result returned nothing.


## Schema Builder

`bin/build-schema` will go through all intents mentioned in all the pills and merge them into a single JSON intent schema in the `schemas/` directory.  Drag or copy+paste the schema into your Alexa Skills Kit code editor.  Any intents with the same name get merged, including their sample utterances.

## Development

It's recommended that you use [bespoken.tools](https://bespoken.tools/).

### Installation

`npm install -g bespoken-tools`

### Use

`bst proxy lambda index.js`

In your terminal, bst will print a link that you can provide to your Alexa skill configuration.  This will proxy requests from an Echo device to your skill.

## Pill Reference

As mentioned above, a pill is merely YAML file containing various configuration keys that are used when building skill responses.

### Label Reference

A label is just a top-level key in a pill file.  They can only live on the top-level; there's no such thing as a nested label.

#### LABEL OBJECT

```yaml
Label Name:
# Your label can be named anything.  When the user does not have an 
# established state, the first label is the first to be evaluated.
  speak: <string|object>
  # This is the simplest way to add speech to your skill response.  
  # Any text provided can include SSML.  You can either provide a 
  # plain string, or you can provide an object with keys for different
  # localizations. 
  # See documentation on the SPEECH object.
  ask: <string|object>
  # An ask is almost exactly the same as `speak:` except it tells the 
  # Alexa-enabled device to wait for a user response.  This prevents 
  # other label keys, such as `utterances:`, `events:`, and `condition:`
  # from evaluating until the user has responded.  It is separate from 
  # `speak:` because it is the default reprompt speech in case `reprompt:`
  # is not specified.  Takes a string or a SPEECH object.
  reprompt: <string|object>
  # Again, similar to `speak:` and `ask:`, but is used when the 
  # Alexa-enabled device waited for the user to say something and said 
  # user didn't respond.  Takes a string or a SPEECH object.
  error speech: <string|object>
  # If something really goes wrong(i.e. an application error occurs),
  # this is the speech that gets sent to the Alexa-enabled device.  
  # It overrides any other speech that may have been specified as part 
  # of the label or from labels that executed previously.  Takes a string 
  # or a SPEECH object.
  go to: <string>
  # Navigates to a different label once the evaluation of the current 
  # label has completed.  May be overridden by label keys such as 
  # `utterances:`, `events:`, or `condition:` if they contain their own
  # `go to:` keys that get evaluated.  Is deferred until the user responds
  # if an `ask:` key is specified in the label.  When no navigation 
  # occurs, execution stops at this label until a new request is made.
  swallow pill: <string>
  # This is like `go to:`, but navigates to a pill.  The string provided
  # should match the file name of the pill sans the ".yml" part.  When used,
  # this overrides `go to:` and defaults the current label state to the 
  # first label in the specified pill.
  assign: <object>
  # This is how values are stored during a session.  They are kept as session
  # attributes.  Takes an ASSIGNMENT object.  
  # See documentation on the ASSIGNMENT object.
  temp: <object>
  # Similar to `assign:`, but stores temporary values that only last for the
  # duration of the current request and do not persist for the rest of the 
  # session.  If a variable specified in `temp:` matches one specified in 
  # `assign:`, it will override the value from `assign:` until it gets cleared.
  # This can get confusing, so it's a good idea to not have variable names 
  # overlap between `assign:` and `temp:`.  Takes an ASSIGNMENT object.  
  # See documentation on the ASSIGNMENT object.
  events: <object>
  # An event is currently synonmymous with the type of skill request being 
  # received.  For example, you may want to have something different happen 
  # when there is a LaunchRequest versus a SessionEndedRequest.  An EVENTS 
  # object shares some basic functionality with the LABEL object, such as 
  # `go to:`, to facilitate navigation.  
  # See documentation on the EVENTS object.
  utterances: <object>
  # This is where you define how the skill reacts to speech from the user.  As
  # with the EVENTS object, the UTTERANCES object shares some basic functionality
  # with the LABEL object so that different speech from the user can facilitate 
  # specific navigation through skill states.  
  # See documentation on the UTTERANCES object.
  web request: <string|object>
  # Make HTTPS requests to external resources by providing either a string with 
  # a URL or a WEB REQUEST object with more options.  This is always executed 
  # before all the other keys when a label is evaluated.  It always expects a 
  # JSON response.  If you need to request something other than JSON(e.g. XML), 
  # you should probably make a separate service to translate what you need into 
  # JSON.  For example, you could write an AWS Lambda function that makes the 
  # initial API request and serves JSON to your skill.  However, it's recommended
  # to not use crappy APIs to begin with.  The result of the request is assigned
  # to the `webResponse` variable, and any top-level keys in the JSON response 
  # are assigned to variables in the current scope.  
  # See documentation on the WEB REQUEST object.
  card: <object>
  # Allows you to return a card as part of the skill response.
  audio: <string|object>
  # Adds an audio directive to the skill response so that the Alexa-enabled device
  # will play the specified audio file.  Simply providing a URL to an audio file 
  # as a string will tell the Alexa-enabled device to clear the queue(REPLACE_ALL)
  # and play the audio.  To stop the currently playing audio, you can provide 
  # "stop" as a string and a stop directive will be added to the request.  
  # Similarly you can "clear enqueued" or "clear all".  The `audio:` key can also 
  # take an AUDIO object, which allows greater finesse of the audio directive.  
  # See documentation on the AUDIO object.
  condition: <object>
  # The equivalent of "if, then, else".  Use this for basic logic switching for 
  # modifying attributes or for navigating.  
  # See documentation on the CONDITION object.
```

## Tests

Testing uses [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).  It's also kinda horseshit at the moment.

`npm install -g mocha`

Run tests with the `mocha` command in the root project folder.
