  Is used in labels to react to events.  An event is often a type of request,
  but can be theoretically any concept of event represented in a request.
  Very similar to the UTTERANCES object, but instead multiple keys may be 
  evaluated in the same request and in the order in which they are defined,
  whereas only one UTTERANCE will occur during a requst.

    description:
      The key name can be the name of a particular event.  For example, you may want
      to have something happen on a LaunchRequest, in which case 'LaunchRequest'
      can be the name of an event key.
