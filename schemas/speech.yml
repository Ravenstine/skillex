  say:
    type: string
    description: |
      Takes a string that gets added to the output speech.
      You will generally not need to use this property since it's easier
      to just use a plain string in the same place you could use a speech object.
  audio:
    type: string
    description: |
      Takes a link to an audio file and appends it to the output speech
      as an SSML audio tag.  This is different from the audio property on the
      label object because it is not using the Audio Directive.
  pause:
    type: string
    description: |
      Adds a break of N seconds.  For example you could specify '2s' for a
      2 second break.
  break:
    type: string
    description: |
      Adds a break of a given strength value.
  random:
    type: array
